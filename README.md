This project is a script for booking tickets on the Taiwan High Speed Rail.

## Disclaimer

This script is for research and reference purposes only. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this script or any violation of terms of service of the Taiwan High Speed Rail website. Please use this script responsibly and ethically.

**Note:** The author will not provide any captcha-solving API. Using such APIs for ticket booking may violate laws or terms of service. Any consequences of such actions are the sole responsibility of the user.

## Installation

First, install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm i
```

## Configuration

Next, go to `src/args.ts` and enter your booking information.

## Compilation

Compile the TypeScript file:
```
tsc src/twHSR.ts
```

**Important:** I don't provide a captcha-solving API. You will need to supply your own or find a suitable API. It is recommended to use an API that can complete recognition within 0.5 seconds.

## Execution

Run the compiled JavaScript file:
```
node src/twHSR.js
```

## Done

That's it! Your ticket booking should now be processed.
